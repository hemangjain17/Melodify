## 🔍 Recommendation Logic

1. Preprocess metadata and generate embeddings.
2. Apply manually defined weights to each feature group.
3. Flatten feature vectors and compute similarity using:
   - Cosine Similarity
   - Inverse Manhattan Distance
   - Equality Check
4. Return top-N most similar tracks based on the aggregated similarity score.
